3. Differenciate between OSI and TCP/IPv4
4. What is data and information?
5. What is computer networking?


## Solutions:
### Describe OSI layer and its importance in computer networking.
OSI (Open System Interconnection), Describes the how computer network communicates with each other in a network. It was developed by ISO **'International Organization for Standardization'** in 1984. Primarily it is a conceptual framework that staandrardize the functions of a system, that helps to undestand and design network. OSI reference model is a 7 layer architecture with each layer having specific functionality to perform.

Importance of OSI in Computer Networking are listed below:
1. OSI model breaks down the system in distinct layer. This will allow us to propery identify the problem by isolating them in the given network. Thus it will be easier to address where the issue is coming form or likely to occur.

2. The OSI model acts as the universal language or the common standard for computer netwokring, allowing different technologoies to communicate using its standard protocol.

3. Computer network is huge and complex to understand at a glance. This is why the OSI model breaks the network in 7 layers. This act of abstraction hels us to understand what process goes under each layers thus making us able to act accordingly.

4. Helps user to determine the required hardware and software to build their network.

5. Helps manufacturer defining which parts of the network their products should work with
