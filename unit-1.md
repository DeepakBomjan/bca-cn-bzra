## 1. Describe OSI layer and its importance in computer networking.
#### Ans. OSI (open system interconnection) is a reference model for how applications communicate over a network. This model focuses on providing a visual design of how each communication layer is built on the top of the other starting with the physical cabling all the way to the application that's trying to coomunicate with other device on a network.OSI model is a layered framework that allows communication between all types of the computer system. It has 7 layers.

## Its importance are:
#### The layers of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model encapsulate every type of network communication across both software and hardware components. The model was designed to allow two standalone systems to communicate via standardised interfaces or protocols based on the current layer of operation.
- Shared understanding of complex systems: Engineers can use the OSI model to organize and model complex networked system architectures. They can separate the operating layer of each system component according to its main functionality. The ability to decompose a system into smaller, manageable parts via abstraction makes it easier for people to conceptualize it as a whole.
- Faster research and development: With the OSI reference model, engineers can understand their work better. They know which technological layer (or layers) they’re developing for when they create new, networked systems that need to communicate with each other. Engineers can develop networked systems and take advantage of a series of repeatable processes and protocols. 
- Flexible standardization: The OSI model does not specify the protocols to use between levels, but rather the tasks that protocols perform. It standardizes network communication development so people can rapidly understand, build, and decompose highly complex systems—all  without prior knowledge of the system. It also abstracts details, so engineers don’t require the understanding of every aspect of the model. In modern applications, the lower levels of networking and protocols are abstracted away to simplify system design and development.
## 2. Describe TCP/IPv4 protocol suite.
#### Ans. TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and is a suite of communication protocols that makes data exchange between two devices possible. TCP/IP specifies how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received on a network by providing end-to-end communication. As compared to the OSI model, which is a theoretical model, TCP/IP is an application and practical model.
####  IP stands for Internet Protocol and v4 stands for Version Four (IPv4). IPv4 was the primary version brought into action for production within the ARPANET in 1983. 
####  IP version four addresses are 32-bit integers which will be expressed in decimal notation. Example- 192.0.2.126 could be an IPv4 address.

## How Does the TCP/IP Protocol Work?
#### Whenever we send things like a simple text message, a file, or a video message over the internet, the TCP/IP model divides the data into packets, according to four-layered architecture. The data goes in order from the sender's side, and on the receiver's side, it follows the reverse order and is finally reassembled.

#### TCP/IP is based on the client-server communication model, which means that a user of a first computer (the client) sends a service request to a second network computer or web hosting provider(server), such as forwarding a Web page. TCP/IP also uses point-to-point communication, which means that data is sent from one host computer to another within a defined network border. In TCP/IP model, each client request is unique and unrelated to previous ones. Hence, it is called stateless, and being stateless allows network channels to be used indefinitely.

#### Because the entire process is standardized, the TCP/IP model works. Without standardization, communication would go haywire, and fast internet service relies on efficiency. The TCP/IP model provides both efficiency and standardization. The TCP/IP model is the most effective way to send internet data because it is the global standard.
