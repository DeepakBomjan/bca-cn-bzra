## Ans. OSI (open system interconnection) is a reference model for how applications communicate over a network. This model focuses on providing a visual design of how each communication layer is built on the top of the other starting with the physical cabling all the way to the application that's trying to coomunicate with other device on a network.OSI model is a layered framework that allows communication between all types of the computer system.
